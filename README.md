Please beware: this package is still a work in progress.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require cion/laravel-cloudflare
```

The package will register itself automatically. 

Optionally, you can publish the package configuration using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=Cion\\LaravelCloudflare\\ServiceProvider
```

This will publish a file called `cloudflare.php` in your `config` folder to adjust a few config values.

## Usage

wip

NOTE: the cache invalidation process can take up to 30 seconds to complete the propagation.

### Suggestion

Run this command during deployment process in order to automate the cache invalidation process before your app's new version becomes active!

## Testing

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database credentials.
2. Run `composer test`.
